# Bicycle-Rental-Prediction

Included is a machine learning project where I attempt to predict the amount of bicycles rented each hour in Washington, DC's rental program.

Some methods explored are:

- Linear Regression

- Decision Tree Regression

- Hyperparameter Optimization

- Random Forest Regression

Information about the data set is linked in the first cell of the project.
